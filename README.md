In our Linux Basics, we already discussed that linux doesn't have extensions to file. It considers extension as file name itself. However as a user we want to know what type of file it is. & easy way of identifying it by extensions. That is the reason we always try to make extensions for the file we create.

In shell we are creating scripts & those we are going to give extensions to understand that as a shell script.

We learn BASH shell here. So the file names can be .bash or even lot of people still use .sh Since linux does not bother about anything, any extension is OK. It is our comfort. I prefer using .sh over .bash

We can execute the script as 'bash script.sh'
